# MLOps 3D Scene Reconstruction

## Overview
This project focuses on **Image Matching and 3D Reconstruction** using advanced feature mapping and global descriptors powered by pre-trained foundation models like **MASt3R** and **DUSt3r**. 

Given a set of multi-view images of a scene, the application recovers the 3D structure by estimating each camera’s rotation matrix (R) and translation vector (t) with high accuracy. This core computer vision capability enables down-stream applications in:
* AR/VR
* Robotics and Autonomous Driving
* Cultural Heritage Digitization
* Surveying and Topography

The offical documentation and guide for this project can be found [here](https://yash-purswani.github.io/MLOps-Project-ME22B214).

The system consists of two distinct layers: an **offline MLOps pipeline** and an **online inference pipeline**.

In the **offline layer**, Airflow orchestrates the execution of the pipeline, while DVC defines the pipeline stages and ensures reproducibility. Different configurations are experimented with using DVC, and each run logs parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow using a local PostgreSQL backend. The best-performing configuration is selected based on evaluation metrics and is associated with a specific Git commit and MLflow run. This combination of code version and configuration is promoted to production.

In the **production layer**, Ray Serve and FastAPI serve the application. When a user uploads a zip file of images, the same pipeline logic is executed directly (without DVC), using the selected configuration. The pipeline performs preprocessing, feature extraction, matching, and 3D reconstruction using COLMAP, producing a `.ply` file which is then visualized in the UI. This separation ensures reproducibility during development and efficiency during inference.

## Pre-trained Models

We have already included the necessary pre-trained models as Git LFS objects in the `extra/pretrained_models` directory. However, if you need to download them manually, you can use the links below:

## Installation & Setup

### Download data
```bash
bash kaggle competitions download -c image-matching-challenge-2025
# Unzip the downloaded file into data/
unzip image-matching-challenge-2025.zip -d data/
# PUt the contents directly in data/ 
mv data/image-matching-challenge-2025/* data/
rm -r data/image-matching-challenge-2025
```

### Docker Mode (Recommended)

1. **Configure `.env` file**: Run the setup script and enter the details.
   ```bash
   ./setup_env.sh
   ```

2. **Generate Docker Secrets**: We use Docker Secrets for managing sensitive data. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./generate_secrets.sh
   chmod 644 ./secrets/*
   ```

3. **Generate Certificates**
    ```bash
    ./generate-certs.sh
    ```

4. **Clone ASMK and CroCo repositories**
    ```bash
    cd extra/
    git clone https://github.com/jenicek/asmk
    git clone https://github.com/naver/croco
    ```

4. **Start the Stack**:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile inference up --build -d
   ```

### Developer Mode (Native)

If you wish to run the project natively for development, follow these steps:

**1. Build ASMK:**
```bash
cd extra/
git clone https://github.com/jenicek/asmk
cd asmk/cython/
cythonize *.pyx
cd ..
python -m build --no-isolation
cd ..
```

**2. Build CroCo / DUSt3r Kernels:**
DUST3R relies on RoPE positional embeddings, requiring compiled CUDA kernels for faster runtime.
```bash
cd extra/
git clone https://github.com/naver/croco.git
cd croco/models/curope/
python -m build --no-isolation
cd ../../
```

**3. Build Packages and Move to Bundle:**
Build the packages as `*.whl` files by running `python -m build --no-isolation` in their respective directories, and move the compiled `.whl` files to `bundle/oss`.

**4. Set up Python Environment:**
Install `uv` and create a virtual environment:
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

# Set library path for PyTorch
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# Source the python venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Running the Project Locally

### 1. DVC / MLflow Offline Pipeline
To run the DVC reproduction graph and track experiments in MLflow:
```bash
PARENT_ID=$(python scripts/start_parent_dvc_run.py | head -n 1)
MLFLOW_PARENT_RUN_ID="$PARENT_ID" dvc repro
python scripts/select_best_run.py
```

### 2. Launching the UI & Backend
Open two separate terminals to run the frontend and backend locally:

**Backend (Terminal 1)**
```bash
cd MLOps-Project-ME22B214/api
ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0 && serve run serve_app:api_node
```

**Frontend (Terminal 2)**
```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

Alternatively, to run the UI & API purely via Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose --profile inference up --build
# → Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# → API:      http://localhost:8000
```

## API Endpoints

## Testing with pytest
The project includes a robust unit testing suite using `pytest`. The tests cover authentication, point cloud decimation utilities, drift monitoring logic, and FastAPI endpoints.

You can run the tests and generate an HTML report using the following command:
```bash
pytest tests/ --html=tests/pytest_report.html --self-contained-html
```
The generated report can be found in `./tests/pytest_report.html`.
